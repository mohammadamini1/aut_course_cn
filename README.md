Computer Network final project

The computer networks final project is about creating a message broker system using Python. It allows publishers to send messages with specific topics to a server, and subscribers can receive those messages based on their chosen topics. The system uses TCP to handle communication between clients and the server. The project includes a multi-threaded server program that processes incoming messages, and a client-side application for publishing and subscribing to topics. It aims to demonstrate effective communication between publishers and subscribers over a local network.
